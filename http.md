# Top HTTP clients

Postman is great, but managing it isn't
The following be can run as CLI. 
- https://httpyac.github.io/
- https://hurl.dev/docs/entry.html



What other alternatives?

- using Makefile to create your own curl
- using nodejs to make requests (if you need programmatic capabilities)
