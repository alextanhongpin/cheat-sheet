## Operating on search matches using gn
- http://vimcasts.org/episodes/operating-on-search-matches-using-gn/

```
- cgn # To delete word, repeat with dot (.)
- dgn # Delete word
```

## Visual Selection

```
prefix all with `v`
it # Select all within tags
at # Select the tag included
aw # mark a word
ab # a block with ()
aB # a block with {}
ib # inner block with ()
iB # inner block with {}
```
## Run the last command line

```
@:
```
## Clearing up registers

```
:qaq # Clears up register "a"
```
## Search

```
:%s/\<hello\>/world/g # Match exact words hello
:%s/hello\s\+world/hello world # Match all spaces between hello and world
```

## Go to column number

```vim
80| # Goes to column 80
```

## Format line to fit 80 characters
Normally for comments

```vim
:gqq
```

## Set vim as the main editor

```

```

## Exit to background

```
ctrl + z (to go to bg)
$ fg (go resume)
```

## Copy whole file 

```vim
:Gygg # go to last line, copy until the first
```
## Register

```
:qaq # clean register a
:"ap # (visual mode) paste content from register a
:"adiw # (visual mode) use register a, then insert the deleted word (diw can be other motion like yy)
:ctrl+r + a # (edit mode) paste content from register a
```
## Sort/sort reverse

```
1,5sort  # Sort alphabetically from line 1 - 5
1,5sort! # Sort in reverse from line 1 - 5
.,+5sort # Sort from current line to next 5 lines (inclusive)
```

## Replace in selected lines

```
1,5s/foo/bar/g # Replace from line 1 to 5 (inclusive)
.,+4s/foo/bar/g # Replace from current line to next 4 lines (inclusive)
```
## Bookmark

```
# in normal mode
m followed by any characters (a-z)
press ` + the character to go to the location
press `` to move quickly between bookmarks
ctrl + g + j (when editing, this will conveniently go down to the next line, will not create new line)
# ctrl + o allows you to run one command only
ctrl + o + o (when editing, this will conveniently go down to the next line)
ctrl + o + shift + i (go to the first line while editing)
ctrl + o + shift + $ (go to the last line, alternatively, ctrl + o + a)
ctrl + o + u (quick undo)
ctrl + c while typing is the same as ctrl + [, which escapes insert mode
```

## Adding Colorschemes
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/flazz/vim-colorschemes.git

# after downloading; unpacking; cd'ing
$ cp colors/* ~/.vim/colors
```
In `.vimrc`:

colo candypaper
colo papercolor
colo jellybeans
colo monokai
colo dracula
let g:airline_theme='dracula'
```

## Vim standardjs setup

Install ale via pathogen:

https://github.com/w0rp/ale#standard-installation

```bash
$ cd ~/.vim/bundle
$ git clone https://github.com/w0rp/ale.git
```

Setup `.vimrc`

https://github.com/standard/standard

```.vimrc
let g:ale_linters = {
\   'javascript': ['standard'],
\}

autocmd bufwritepost *.js silent !standard --fix %
set autoread

" Write this in your vimrc file
let g:ale_lint_on_text_changed = 'never'
" You can disable this option too
" if you don't want linters to run on opening a file
let g:ale_lint_on_enter = 0

" Set this. Airline will handle the rest.
let g:airline#extensions#ale#enabled = 1
```


## Vim-airline
```
$ git clone https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline ~/.vim/bundle/vim-airline
```

## Vim airline theme (including dracula)

## Enable syntax highlighting for golang

```
let g:go_highlight_structs = 1
let g:go_highlight_methods = 1
let g:go_highlight_functions = 1
let g:go_highlight_operators = 1
let g:go_highlight_build_constraints = 1
```

## Insert mode shortcuts

```
ctrl + w: delete previous word
ctrl + u: delete whole line
ctrl + p/n: autocomplete suggestions
ctrl + [: exit insert mode, go to normal mode (easier to access than esc key)
```

## Normal mode shortcuts

```
:ddp - delete current line, paste it to next line (use to swap lines)
:%s/foo/bar/gI - replace all foo with bar, case sensitive
```

## Visual mode shortcuts

```
:< - unindent the line 
:> - indent the line
:vbx - enter visual mode, go backward one words and delete the word (faster to type ctrl + w)
:ctrl + v, ctrl + i // - enter visual mood multi-select, insert character for all positions
```

## Good Light Theme

Seoul256, Tomorow, PaperColor, and Solarized Light, gruvbox, hemisu and Kalisi.


## TypeScript + Vue support

```
# Install tsuquyomi.
git clone https://github.com/Quramy/tsuquyomi.git ~/.vim/bundle/tsuquyomi

# Syntax highlighting for Vue components.
Plugin 'posva/vim-vue'
# OR
cd ~/.vim/bundle && \
git clone https://github.com/posva/vim-vue.git

# Typescript
git clone https://github.com/leafgarland/typescript-vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/typescript-vim
```

## Set tabwidth for specific language

Just put the settings into the filetype plugin file ~/.vim/ftplugin/LANGUAGE.vim . My ~/.vim/ftplugin/perl.vim contains the lines:

```.vimrc
"
" ---------- tabulator / shiftwidth --------------------
"  Set tabulator and shift width to 4 (Perl Style Guide)
"
setlocal  tabstop=2
setlocal  shiftwidth=2
"
```

## Format typescript
https://github.com/google/vim-codefmt
```bash
$ brew install clang-format
$ yarn global add prettier
$ yarn global js-prettify
```

# Alternative Theme
https://github.com/cormacrelf/vim-colors-github


## Modifying specific language indentation

```
# create folder if not exist
$ touch ~/.vim/ftplugin/LANGUAGE.vim

"
" ---------- tabulator / shiftwidth --------------------
"  Set tabulator and shift width to 4 (Perl Style Guide)
"
setlocal  tabstop=4
setlocal  shiftwidth=4
"
```

## HTML Autocomplete for react

```
" Plugin alvan/vim-closetag
let g:closetag_filenames = "*.html,*.xhtml,*.phtml,*.php,*.jsx,*.js"
let g:closetag_xhtml_filetypes = 'xhtml,js,jsx'
```

## Autoclose vim tag

https://github.com/cohama/lexima.vim


```
Ctrl + ^: goes back to previous file
```


## Setting up true color support

The actual implementation that works:
https://jdhao.github.io/2018/10/19/tmux_nvim_true_color/


## Vim update multiple files




https://dev.to/iggredible/how-to-search-and-replace-string-in-multiple-files-in-vim-20g2

```bash
// Find all typescript files in the folder src/currency and add to current args
:args src/currency/**.ts

// Replace and save all files
:argdo %s/currency/employment-type/gI | update

// Check the current args in selection
:arg
```

## Nerdtree Enter/Exit directory

Reduces cognitive load when working with aplication with many folders:

```
# To enter
Shift + c

# To go up the directory
Shift + u
```

## Vim find and delete
```
:g/George Bush/d
```
That’s all you need to do. This vim search/delete command will find and then delete all lines containing the pattern “George Bush”.

How this vi search/delete command works
Here’s a brief explanation of how this vi/vim search and delete command works:
```
The : character says "put vim in last-line mode".
The g characters says "perform the following operation globally in this file".
The forward slash characters enclose the pattern I'm trying to match. In this case it's a very simple sequence of characters, but it can also be a more complicated regular expression.
The d at the end of the command says "When you find this pattern, delete the line".
```


## Nerdtree Toggle

```
Shift + ?: Toggle help
P - go to root
X - close all children recursively
R - refresh current root (Not sure if this is necessary)
```

## Bookmark

```
Show bookmark: B
Add bookmark: :bookmark
Delete bookmark (at bookmark bar): D
```


## Find file path
- full path: 1 ctrl+g
- current file: ctrl+g, or :fs
- to copy in insert mode: In insert mode, type Ctrl-r then % to insert the name of the current file

## Get current file, and directory in command mode

Useful when running commands in directory

```
:echo @%                |" directory/name of file
:echo expand('%:t')     |" name of file ('tail')
:echo expand('%:p')     |" full path
:echo expand('%:p:h')   |" directory containing file ('head')
```


## Sort

```
:sort (sorts alphabetically)
:sort n (to sorts numerically)
```
